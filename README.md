# adversarial-postspec
Code and scripts for our adversarial post-specialisation model, as a follow-up of the NAACL-HLT 2018 submission by VuliÄ‡ et al.

To run the regression training, you should run the following command:
`python maxmargin_ffn_bow2.py <output_file>`

The output (post-specialised SimLex and SimVerb words) will be stored in the ./results/ directory.
